= REST tasks

The REST task performs REST calls and outputs the responses as objects.

The work item handler for REST tasks is the `RestWorkItemHandler` class and this is capable of interacting with the REST service and supports the following:

* Authentication type: Secured or open
* Authentication method: Basic or form-based

You can specify the authentication information during handler initialization. This can be overridden using work item parameters. Other configuration options must be specified in the work item parameters map.
