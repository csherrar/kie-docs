= Managing data sources

Business Central provides data source management, which allows you to define data sources for accessing a database. These data sources are then used by other Business Central components such as the data sets. A database driver, on the other hand, is used for enabling communication between a data source and the targeted database.

From the *Data Source Authoring* page you can add data sources and database drivers to {CENTRAL}.

[NOTE]
====
{CENTRAL} provides a default data source that can be used but can not be edited or deleted.
