[id='environment-mode-con']
= Environment mode in {KIE_SERVER} and {CENTRAL}

You can set {KIE_SERVER} to run in `production mode`, formerly the default setting, or in `development mode`, the new default setting.

Development mode provides a flexible deployment policy that enables you to update existing deployment units (KIE containers) while maintaining active process instances for small changes, or to reset the deployment unit state before updating active process instances for bigger changes.

Production mode is optimal for production environments, where each deployment creates a new deployment unit, as in previous releases.

By default, {KIE_SERVER} and all new projects in {CENTRAL} are in development mode. You cannot deploy a project with *Development Mode* turned on or with a manually added `SNAPSHOT` version suffix to a {KIE_SERVER} that is in production mode.
