[id='_custom-tasks-{context}']
= Custom tasks

You can use custom tasks to develop operations that {PRODUCT} does not directly provide and include them in process diagrams.


In {CENTRAL}, each task in a process diagram has a `WorkItem` Java class with an associated `WorkItemHandler` Java class. The work item handler contains Java code registered with {CENTRAL} and implements `org.kie.api.runtime.process.WorkItemHandler`. The Java code of the work item handler is executed when the task is triggered.

You can customize and register a work item handler to execute your own Java code in custom tasks.
