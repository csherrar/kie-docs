= User management

{CENTRAL} defines three types of entities for security management - users, groups, and roles. You can assign permissions both roles and groups. {CENTRAL} allows you to assign the following roles:

* process-admin
* manager
* admin
* analyst
* developer
* user

[NOTE]
====
A role's identifier that is present in the application Role Registry is a role. If not, it is a group.
====

Use {CENTRAL} to create and manage as many users and groups as you require. A user must be assigned to at least one user-specific role to log in to {CENTRAL}. User privileges depend on permissions from the groups and roles that the user is a member of. Note that the role or group priority is considered if a user has several roles or groups assigned to it.
