= Process instance migration

Process instance migration (PIM) is a Technology Preview standalone service containing a user interface and a backend, and packaged as a Thorntail uber-jar. You can use the process instance migration service to define the migration between two different process definitions, known as a migration plan. The user can then apply the migration plan to the running process instance in a specific process server.
